# ⚓ Captain Morse | A simple but life saving app ⚓

### What this app is about

Captain Morse is a little word-guessing game using Morse Code. The app outlines the imaginative situation where Captain Morse is on his boat and sinking due to a storm. Signaling 'SOS' in Morse Code does not work ( ... \_\_\_ ...) - so the urgent riddle is: _Which message does work to the lives of Captain Morse and his desparate crew?_

\*\*\* note: The only browser that currently supports this app is Google Chrome, this is due voice recognition software.

### Goals of this project

As part of Codaisseur's Web Development Bootcamp an assignment was given: build an app, with one fellow student, in one week, given the theme 'Language and letters'.

### Tech used in the project

- ReactJS for UI building (frontend only, no backend)
- the built-in web brower speech recognition engine for converting speech to transcript
- JS functions to convert transcripts to morse code
- the built-in tone generator to output Morse Code in sound
- timed displaying of 4 PNG images to render synchronous Morse Code 'flashing'
